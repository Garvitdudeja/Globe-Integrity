        GROWTHSURANCE, LLC (Globe Integrity Info”) is a solicitor for the third-party
        advisors on our platform. These advisors pay RetirementInfo a referral
        fee for prospective client introductions. This referral fee varies based
        on the information you supply in the Questionnaire and the desired
        client profile of the Matched Advisor. In return, we provide the Matched
        Advisor with the information you provide us through our Questionnaire,
        including phone number and e-mail address. This fee is paid solely by
        the Matched Advisor and is paid to RetirementInfo regardless of whether
        or not you become a client of the Matched Advisor. There are no fees to
        you for the use of our platform. RetirementInfo is not otherwise
        affiliated with the Matched Advisor and does not provide investment
        advice on its behalf.Participating Advisers pay us a fee for each
        Investor introduction. Participating Advisers may pay different levels
        of fees based on a combination of demand and profile of the Investors
        matched and introduced. This creates a conflict of interest because we
        could generate more revenue by introducing Investors to the
        Participating Adviser willing to spend the most, rather than the
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        adviser that best suits an Investor’s needs. We mitigate this risk by
        only introducing Investors to Participating Advisers that are deemed
        suitable and match based on information Investors self-report through
        our platform. Where multiple Participating Advisers meet the
        requirements identified by an Investor and are deemed equally suitable,
        the introduction will be made to the Participating Adviser that is
        willing to pay us the highest referral fee, as determined through an
        auction.About us
